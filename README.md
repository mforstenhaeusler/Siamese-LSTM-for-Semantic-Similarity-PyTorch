# Semantic-Similarity-Using-a-LSTM-NN

This repositpory entails an implementation of a Siamese LSTM Neural Network that evaulates the semantic similarity of two sentenences using pytorch. 

It consists of 2 modules: \
    - a data module \
    - a model module

The data module handles the data preparation and data loading. 
The model module handles the model configuration and the training and evaluation algorithms-
